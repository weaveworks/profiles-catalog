This repository is an example of how to build Weave Gitops Profiles for a kubernetes cluster to be consumed by the Weave Gitops Profile controller.

[Weave Gitops Project on Github](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave-gitops)

# Usage

This repository is provided as an example of a collection of profiles for an organization that would like to build kubernetes clusters with platform components to build a PaaS like experience for developers.

This repository should not be used for production deployments as it requires further customisation for real world use.
In addition the default deployment values may not be properly secured.

The purpose of publishing this repository is to provide an example of Weave Gitops Profiles to be used in demos and as a base for further customisation.

Please read the documentation for how to set up a profiles-catalog repo of your own and how to consume it from Weave Gitops.

# Contents
